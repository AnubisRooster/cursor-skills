name: jira-create-issues
description: Create Jira Epics/Features and child sprint issues via the mcp-atlassian server (self-hosted Jira Data Center), enforcing a mandatory field set (Summary, Description, Epic Link/Parent Link, Estimate, Components, Labels, Function area, Business Value, Acceptance Criteria, Definition of Ready, Definition of Done) and a hierarchical WBS numbering rule (Initiative X.0 -> Epic/Feature X.Y -> Story/Task/Test/Defect X.Y.Z) regardless of what Jira's screens require. Business Value/AC/DoR/DoD live in dedicated custom fields ONLY for every issue type (Initiative, Epic, Feature, Story, Task, Test, Defect) and are never duplicated in the description; the sole exceptions are Business Value on Task and all four on Sub-task, which have no screen slot and fall back to description headings. Enforces the three-orthogonal-dimensions model (Pillars=Components, Teams=Labels, Programs=Initiatives), 8 pillar-based components, team/product/BU labels, cross-pillar work rules, and initiative gating. Always shows the proposed payload to the user for approval before creating. Use when the user asks to create, draft, file, scaffold, or open a Jira Epic, Feature, Story, Task, Test, Defect, or sub-task under an Epic/Feature/Initiative.

# Jira: Create Epics, Features, and Sprint Issues (mcp-atlassian)

This skill governs how the agent creates Jira issues through the `user-mcp-atlassian` MCP server against a **self-hosted Jira Data Center** instance. It enforces a stricter mandatory field set than Jira's screens require and the organisation's three-dimension governance model.

## Initiative → Epic/Feature → Sprint-Issue Hierarchy

This project uses a multi-level hierarchy:

1. **Initiative** — top-level parent. Carries the WBS root number with a **pillar prefix** (e.g. `0.0 OPS: Operational Tasks & General Work`, `1.0 DCM: Knowledge Graph Platform`).
2. **Epic / Feature** — children of the Initiative and peers at the same hierarchy level. They share the same `X.Y` WBS sequence.
3. **Story / Task / Test / Defect** — sprint-level delivery issues under an Epic or Feature. Inherit `X.Y.Z`.
4. **Sub-task** — granular work items under Story/Task/Test/Defect.

### Epic vs Feature decision rule

- Use **Feature** when the scoped deliverable should close within roughly one quarter (typically <= 2 months).
- Use **Epic** when work is broad, exploratory, or expected to run across multiple quarters.
- If unclear, default to **Feature** and note the assumption in the proposal for user confirmation.
